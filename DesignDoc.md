## Colony Ship of Theseus

Mostly text based game. There are 10 stops on your way from your home planet to the target planet. Your home planet has mandated that your colony ship *must* arrive with at least one original part still attached.

**Success State:** Arrive at the planet successfully
**Fail States:** No more original parts in service or no functioning parts.

Each part of the ship has a **rating**. This ranges as follows:
0. Broken
1. Damaged
2. Nominal
3. Upgraded

At each stop, there is an **event**. These are as follows...

### Break Event
*Something on your ship has broken or is at risk of breaking*

Choices:
1. Systems check to save it or minimize damage *(eg: Weapons 2 required or Shield 1 Sensors 1 required)*
2. Repurpose another system to save it (-2 rating on the salvaged system)
3. Accept that it is broken

### Resource Event
*You have found some sort of resource in space that you may be able to exploit*

Choices:
1. Systems check to exploit the resource *(eg: R&D 2 required, +1 Sensor rating)*
2. Sacrifice a system to exploit the resource *(eg: Damage Shields 1, +1 Engines)*
3. Ignore the resource

### Route Event
*Something might change your route for the better or worse*

Choices:
1. Systems check to take advantage or avoid negative
2. Damage system to avoid negative (only on negatives)
3. Accept negative/ignore positive (Do nothing)

### Systems
* Sensors
* Shields
* Weapons
* Refinery/Excavation/Hangar
* Navigation/Engines
* R&D/Science/Labs


### Unused Ideas

*Alternative Systems for expansion*
* Life Support (fail if lost)
* Entertainment/Morale/Crew Quarters
* Medbay
* Bioreactors (food) (fail if lost)

*Crew/Engineers as secondary resource*
* Can sacrifice engineers to problems
* No engineers, no more repairs possible
* Ship can still arrive on autopilot with no engineers, so not immediate fail state
